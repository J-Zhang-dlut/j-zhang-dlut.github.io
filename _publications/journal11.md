Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) plays an important role in the treatment, which has made great contributions to the health of people. However, the subjectivity,ambiguity and irregularity of the TCM diagnoses have posed vast challenges to the sustainable development of TCM. To solve those challenges, some data mining-based TCM diagnosis methods are proposed, well exploring the essential rules hidden in the TCM treatment. The paper reviewed the recent data mining-based TCM diagnosis methods and expounds the impressive results of data mining-based methods in promoting the TCM diagnosis objectification and standardization. In particular, the paper summarized the data mining methods which were widely used in TCM diagnoses, by introducing the algorithm characteristics and the TCM application scenarios. And then, the paper systematically explained the latest research progress in the data mining-based TCM diagnoses from the perspectives of compatibility laws of prescriptions, the diagnosis of syndrome and relationships between prescriptions and syndromes. Finally, some future research problems in the data mining-based TCM diagnosis were provided.
